# medical_chatbot
This project is a web-based Medical Diagnosis Assistant chatbot built using Gradio, powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash via Google's generativeai library. It leverages a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach by extracting medical knowledge from a local PDF document and using it to provide context-aware responses to symptom-related queries.
